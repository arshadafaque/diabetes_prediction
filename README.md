**Overview**
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various health metrics using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals for early intervention.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is [PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset] which contains information such as:

Number of pregnancies
Glucose level
Blood pressure
Skin thickness
Insulin level
Body Mass Index (BMI)
Diabetes pedigree function
Age
The dataset is publicly available and also i have attached dataset in my repository.


**Models and Techniques**
The following machine learning models are used in this project:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting
The models are evaluated based on various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best performing model is then selected for deployment.

**Contributing**
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvement or new features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
